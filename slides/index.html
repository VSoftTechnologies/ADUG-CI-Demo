# Continuous Integration with Delphi and Continua CI

---

# Agenda

1. Devops Quick Overview 
2. What is Continuous Integration
3. CI For Solo Developers
4. CI vs Automated Builds
5. A quick look at the Build Script.
6. CI Getting started.

# Devops Quick Overview
The term 'DevOps' was coined by Patrick Debois, who is considered one of the methodologyâ€™s primary gurus (not Microsoft!)
- Emphasis on breaking down Development and Operations Silos. 
- Automation of the Software Development Lifecycle
- Collaboration and Communication
- Focus on User needs and short feeback loops

# What is Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.

---

# Continuous Integration benefits

- Feedback loop results in faster bug fixes  
- Reduced risk - tests run after every build 
- Fault isolation is easier
- Progress & Qualilty tracking
- Saves time and resources (automate all the things)
- Release more often (because it's easy)

---
# CI for solo developers?

- Do you run your unit tests after every code change?
- Running tests on dev machine can be time consuming 
- Automation is still worthwhile - humans are terrible at repetitive tasks
- Makes it easier to exit a business - can hand it over in a buildable state

---

# CI vs Automated Builds

- Automated Build - what/how to build
- Continous Integration - When/Where to build
- CI Servers have operation knowledge, it knows about the environment
- Build Scripts know about source code structure, dependencies  
- Build Script should be in version control along with your source code 
- Separation of concerns - avoid hard coding knowledge in multiple locations
- Pass variables from CI server to Build Script (eg, passwords, server locations)

# Getting started with CI

- Determine inputs and outputs
- Create a build script (batch file, msbuild, FinalBuilder)
- Make your build script location agnostic (use variables)
- Configure your CI to run your build script

# The Build Script - Batch files

- Arcane syntax - 

# The Build script - MSBuild

- Delphi projects are MSBuild projects
- Not all settings available from the command line
- Editing the xml is hard if you have multiple configurations
- On your own when it comes to Version Information.
- Depends on Environment variables - rsvars.bat
